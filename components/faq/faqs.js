        question: "How to report?",
        answer: `
        If you suspect someone is dualboxing or botting
        Send **@Seriel** or **@GiN** a private message on discord.
        This is preferred.
        
        # Example: #
        'I have found a bot on Signature 
        nickname: test1234
        '
        !report.gif
        # Additionally, you can report ingame #
        !botreport.gif
        # or make a ticket (for other reasons): #
        !ticket.gif
        `
    },
    {
        question: "When will you reply to my ticket?",
        answer: `
        & As soon as possible &
        1. Asking about ticket updates will **move your ticket to the back of the queue**.
        2. Opening **multiple tickets** for the same matter will **result in sanctions**.
        3. **Pestering GMs** on Discord, forums, or in-game about tickets created **less than 48 hours ago will be sanctioned**.

        question: "How many accounts can I have or play?",
        answer: `
        # A player can only play with one character at a time per server. #
        1. **ONE** offline shop and **ONE** online character doesn't count as dualbox.
        2. You can have as many accounts as you want, but dualbox rule applies.
        3. You can only play with **ONE** character at a time.
        4. You can relog to another character as long as you are only playing with **ONE** character at a time.
